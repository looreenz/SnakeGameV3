# Snake Game V3

A Java snake game developed in Processing IDE and its API with info page, sound control and difficulty selection:

**Easy:** the classic snake game, don't touch the edges or yourself or you'll die;

**Medium:** a set of wall is placed with random positions at the beginning if the game;

**Hard:** every apple eaten, one wall more on the table, with random position so watch out!

The only thing you need to do is press **Play** and **have fun**!
